	Abstract = {Transfection is a powerful analytical tool enabling study of the function of genes and gene products in cells. The transfection methods are broadly classified into three groups; biological, chemical, and physical. These methods have advanced to make it possible to deliver nucleic acids to specific subcellular regions of cells by use of a precisely controlled laser-microscope system. The combination of point-directed transfection and mRNA transfection is a new way of studying the function of genes and gene products. However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages so the optimum method depends on experimental design and objective.},

@article{Fraley:1980aa,
	Abstract = {DNA, isolated from Simian virus 40 (SV40), has been encapsulated in large (0.4-micrometer diameter) unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The procedure used for liposome preparation encapsulated the SV40 DNA at high efficiency (30 to 50% entrapment) and did not alter the physical or biological properties of the DNA molecules. The biological activity of the liposome-entrapped viral DNA was determined by plaque assays on a permissive monkey cell line. The infectivity of liposome-entrapped SV40 DNA was enhanced at least 100-fold over that of free naked DNA. Importantly, the infectivity of vesicle-entrapped DNA was resistant to DNase digestion, dependent on the amount of DNA encapsulated per vesicle and on the vesicle lipid composition. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine were the most efficient for delivery of DNA to cells (1.8 x 10(3) plaque-forming units/micrograms of DNA). Following the incubation of DNA-containing liposomes with cells, their infectivity could be enhanced an additional 10- to 200-fold by exposing the cells to high concentrations of polyethylene glycol or glycerol. Under these conditions the infectivity of liposome-encapsulated SV40 DNA (3 x 10(5) plaque-forming units/microgram) was comparable with values reported using the calcium phosphate method. In addition to providing a sensitive assay for monitoring and optimizing the delivery of vesicle contents to cells, the liposome-mediated delivery of nucleic acids may have potential for increasing the efficiency of DNA delivery to cells and for extending the number of cell types which can be transformed or transfected.},

@article{Fraley:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Delivery of liposome-encapsulated simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA to African green monkey Related to been used as a probe to study liposome--cell interactions and to determine conditions which favor the intracellular delivery of liposome contents to cells. The efficiency of DNA delivery by various liposome preparations (monitored by infectivity assays) was found to be dependent both on the magnitude of vesicle binding to cells and on the resistance of liposomes to cell-induced leakage of contents. Acidic phospholipids were much more effective in both binding and delivery, and phosphatidylserine (PS) was the best in both aspects. The inclusion of 50 mol % cholesterol in liposomes reduces the cell-induced leakage of vesicle contents (2--5-fold) and substantially enhances the delivery of DNA to cells (2--10-fold). Following incubation of cells with negatively charged liposomes containing SV40 DNA, infectivity can be enhanced greatly by brief exposure of the cells to glycerol solutions. In contrast, only slight enhancement by glycerol was observed for SV40 DNA encapsulated in neutral or positively charged liposomes. The results of competition experiments between empty phosphatidylcholine liposomes and DNA-containing PS liposomes also suggest possible differences in the interaction of neutral and negatively charged liposome preparations with cells. Morphological studies indicate that the glycerol treatment stimulates membrane ruffling and vacuolization and suggest that the enhanced uptake of liposomes occurs by an endocytosis-like process. Results obtained with metabolic inhibitors are also consistent with the interpretation that the enhancement of liposome delivery in glycerol-treated cells occurs via an energy-dependent endocytotic pathway. Pretreatment of cells with chloroquine, a drug which alters lysosomal activity, further enhanced infectivity in glycerol-treated cells (4-fold). This observation suggests the involvement of a lysosomal processing step at some point in the expression of liposome-encapsulated DNA and, more importantly, illustrates the possibility of altering cellular mechanism to engineer more efficient delivery by liposomes. Under optimal conditions determined in this study, the efficiency of liposome-mediated SV40 DNA delivery was increased more than 1000-fold over that obtained by simply incubating cells with liposomes. It is also demonstrated that these conditions enhance delivery of other molecules, besides DNA, which are encapsulated in liposomes.},

@article{Straus:1980aa,
	Abstract = {Cell ghosts were formed by hypotonic haemolysis and subsequent isotonic re-sealing of human erythrocytes in the presence of adenovirus type 2 DNA. The ghosts entrapped virus DNA with an efficiency which depended on the salt concentration employed during haemolysis and on the concentration of the DNA itself. The entrapped DNA was largely protected from digestion by deoxyribonuclease I and could be recovered intact by phenol extraction. Erythrocyte ghosts containing 32P-adenovirus type 2 DNA were fused with KB cells during brief treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Following fusion, counts equivalent to an average of 25 molecules of labelled DNA were micro-injected and transported to each KB cell nucleus. Less than 1/4 as many DNA counts were recovered from nuclei when PEG treatment was omitted. A direct immunofluorescent assay demonstrated virus replication in some cells following their fusion with DNA-containing ghosts. The efficiency of transfection was considerably lower than that expected from the large number of successfully micro-injected DNA molecules. This suggests that most of the micro-injected DNA molecules were degraded before a successful infection could be completed.},

@article{Neumann:1982aa,
	Abstract = {Electric impulses (8 kV/cm, 5 microseconds) were found to increase greatly the uptake of DNA into cells. When linear or circular plasmid DNA containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene is added to a suspension of mouse L cells deficient in the TK gene and the cells are then exposed to electric fields, stable transformants are formed that survive in the HAT selection medium. At 20 degrees C after the application of three successive electric impulses followed by 10 min to allow DNA entry there result 95 (+/- 3) transformants per 10(6) cells and per 1.2 micrograms DNA. Compared with biochemical techniques, the electric field method of gene transfer is very simple, easily applicable, and very efficient. Because the mechanism of DNA transport through cell membranes is not known, a simple physical model for the enhanced DNA penetration into cells in high electric fields is proposed. According to this ' electroporation model' the interaction of the external electric field with the lipid dipoles of a pore configuration induces and stabilizes the permeation sites and thus enhances cross membrane transport.},

	Abstract = {The enhancement by diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) of the infectivity of poliovirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) for cell cultures was demonstrated by infective-center as well as by plaque assays, both in nonprimate (L) and primate cell systems (MK, HeLa, LLC-MK(2)). The sensitivity of plaque assays was greatly improved by using a tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-buffered synthetic medium (basal medium Eagle) and freshly confluent cell monolayers. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was directly dependent on the molecular weight of the DEAE-D. Two observations bearing on the action of DEAE-D appeared important: ribonuclease activity was reduced by DEAE-D, and cells pretreated with DEAE-D remained susceptible to infection with RNA in isotonic medium. Appreciable susceptibility of the treated cells persisted for at least 2 hr; the susceptible state could be reversed at will by an application of heparin. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was independent of an effect of DEAE-D on intact virus and agar inhibitors.},

@article{Cepko:1984aa,
	Abstract = {We develop a murine retrovirus shuttle vector system for the efficient introduction of selectable and nonselectable DNA sequences into mammalian cells and recovery of the inserted sequences as molecular clones. Three protocols allow rapid recovery of vector DNA sequences from mammalian cells. Two of the methods rely on SV40 T-antigen-mediated replication of the vector sequences and yield thousands of bacterial transformants per 5 X 10(6) mammalian cells. The majority of plasmids recovered by all three protocols exhibited the proper structure and were as active as the parental vector in the generation of transmissible retrovirus genomes upon transfection of mammalian cells. One of the rescue methods, which relies on "onion skin" replication and excision of an integrated provirus from the host chromosome, enables facile recovery of the chromosomal site of proviral integration. The system was also used to generate, and then efficiently recover, a cDNA version of a genomic insert from the adenovirus E1A region.},
