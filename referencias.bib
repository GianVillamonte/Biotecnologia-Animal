abstract={Gene therapy for the treatment of cancer was initiated with high levels of optimism and enthusiasm. Recently, this perception has had to be tempered by the realisation that efficiency and accuracy of gene delivery remain the most significant barriers to its success. So far, there has been a disappointing inability to reach target cells with sufficient efficacy to generate high enough levels of direct killing and this has necessitated the invocation of bystander effects in order for any potential strategy to be convincing. At least in the foreseeable future, clinical advance will come from co-operation with other more established disciplines - such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This is inevitable - and necessary - in order to prove that gene therapy can have efficacy as part of a combinatorial therapy, before hoping to move clinical mountains alone. In addition, there will have to be a thorough understanding of the clinical situations in which gene therapy will be used in order both to understand its own limitations, and to exploit its full potential. This will enable it to find the appropriate clinical niche in which its abilities will be optimally useful. Finally, anyone wishing to practise clinical cancer gene therapy will rapidly have to learn the ways of the free market and be able to juggle commercial necessities with ideological purity.

abstract={Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. They play a vital role in the initiation of immune response by presenting antigens to T cells and followed by induction of T-cell response. Reported research in animal studies indicated that vaccine immunity could be a promising alternative therapy for cancer patients. However, broad clinical utility has not been achieved yet, owing to the low transfection efficiency of DCs. Therefore, it is essential to improve the transfection efficiency of DC-based vaccination in immunotherapy. In several studies, DCs were genetically engineered by tumor-associated antigens or by immune molecules such as costimulatory molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Encouraging results have been achieved in cancer treatment using various animal models. This paper describes the recent progress in gene delivery systems including viral vectors and nonviral carriers for DC-based genetically engineered vaccines. The reverse and three-dimensional transfection systems developed in DCs are also discussed.},

abstract ={We have developed an efficient and reproducible method for RNA transfection, using a synthetic cationic lipid, N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), incorporated into a liposome (lipofectin). Transfection of 10 ng to 5 micrograms of Photinus pyralis luciferase mRNA synthesized in vitro into NIH 3T3 mouse cells yields a linear response of luciferase activity. The procedure can be used to efficiently transfect RNA into human, rat, mouse, Xenopus, and Drosophila cells. Using the RNA/lipofectin transfection procedure, we have analyzed the role of capping and beta-globin 5' and 3' untranslated sequences on the translation efficiency of luciferase RNA synthesized in vitro. Following transfection of NIH 3T3 cells, capped mRNAs with beta-globin untranslated sequences produced at least 1000-fold more luciferase protein than mRNAs lacking these elements.},

abstract ={Liposomes modified with TAT peptide (TATp-liposomes) showed fast and efficient translocation into the cell cytoplasm with subsequent migration into the perinuclear zone. TATp-liposomes containing a small quantity (≤10 mol %) of a cationic lipid formed firm noncovalent complexes with DNA. Here, we present results demonstrating both in vitro and in vivo transfection with TATp-liposome–DNA complexes. Mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were transfected with such complexes in vitro. The transfection with the TATp-liposome-associated pEGFP-N1 plasmid encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was high, whereas the cytotoxicity was lower than that of commonly used cationic lipid-based gene-delivery systems. Intratumoral injection of TATp-liposome–DNA complexes into the Lewis lung carcinoma tumor of mice also resulted in an expression of GFP in tumor cells. This transfection system should be useful for various protocols of cell treatment in vitro or ex vivo as well as for localized in vivo gene therapy.},

In this new, simple, and convenient polycation-dimethyl sulfoxide transfection, which requires no carrier DNA even with small amounts of DNA, the number of transformed cell foci induced by Rous sarcoma virus DNA was proportional to the dose of the transfecting DNA, and chicken embryo fibroblast cells were successfully transformed by v-src-containing subgenomic DNA as well.},

abstract={Gene therapy involves the transfer and expression of a therapeutic gene into a target tissue, and essentially represents an intervention that alters the instruction set of a cell having a dominant effect on the cell phenotype. Gene therapy techniques may provide a realistic therapeutic option for CNS disorders that are difficult to treat with conventional drugs, such as for drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Preclinical studies using a selection of 'therapeutic'genes delivered into the rodent brain showed significant reduction of seizures and inhibition of epileptogenesis, thus establishing the proof-of-principle evidence of the potential applicability of this technology to human epilepsy. The promising potential of gene therapy for the treatment of CNS pathologies still requires further investigation to improve the efficacy and the safety of this approach using clinically relevant experimental models. The recent advances in refining gene therapy tools and in methods of gene delivery make this innovative approach a definite possibility for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract={The eye has unique advantages as a target organ for gene therapy of both inherited and acquired ocular disorders and offers a valuable model system for gene therapy. The eye is readily accessible to phenotypic examination and investigation of therapeutic effects in vivo by fundus imaging and electrophysiological techniques. Considerable progress has been made in the development of gene replacement therapies for retinal degenerations resulting from gene defects in photoreceptor cells (rds, RPGRIP, RS-1) and in retinal pigment epithelial cells (MerTK, RPE65, OA1) using recombinant adeno-associated virus and lentivirus-based vectors. Gene therapy also offers a potentially powerful approach to the treatment of complex acquired disorders such as those involving angiogenesis, inflammation and degeneration, by the targeted sustained intraocular delivery of therapeutic proteins. Proposals for clinical trials of gene therapy for early-onset retinal degeneration owing to defects in the gene encoding the visual cycle protein RPE65 have recently received ethical approval.},

abstract={Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function. It is hoped that forming tissue de novo will overcome many problems in plastic surgery associated with such areas as wound healing and the immunogenicity of transplanted tissue that lead to dysfunctional repair. Gene therapy is the science of the transfer of genetic material into individuals for therapeutic purposes by altering cellular function or structure at the molecular level. Recently, tissue engineering has been used in conjunction with gene therapy as a hybrid approach. This combination of stem-cell-based tissue engineering with gene therapy has the potential to provide regenerative tissue cells within an environment of optimal regulatory protein expression and would have many benefits in various areas such as the transplantation of skin, cartilage or bone. The aim of this review is to outline tissue engineering and possible applications of gene therapy in the field of biomedical engineering as well as basic principles of gene therapy, vectors and gene delivery.

abstract={The concept and application of ethical principles in the context of medical research is changing rapidly. This is especially true for fast moving fields such as gene therapy, a relatively new but rapidly maturing field offering opportunities to influence health at a fundamental level, which may become a cornerstone of medicine. By 2004, over 700 gene therapy clinical protocols had been initiated worldwide, and two highly publicized gene therapy-related side effects have helped to shape recent ethical debate. These events have influenced not only clinical trial design but also public opinion and systems of independent oversight. Both the science of gene therapy and the regulatory environment are continually evolving. How well the field is able to respond to these challenges will determine the extent to which gene therapy will ultimately be integrated into medical practice.},

TGF-beta and PDGF are known to play a critical role in the regulation of ECM metabolism and mesenchymal cell proliferation, respectively. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the direct role of each of these growth factors in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. Using an in vivo transfection technique, we could realize the selective overexpression of single growth factor in the kidney. The introduction of either TGF-beta or PDGF-B gene alone into the kidney induced glomerulosclerosis, although the patterns of action of these growth factors were different; TGF-beta affected ECM accumulation rather than cell proliferation and PDGF affected the latter rather than the former.},

abstract ={A DNA-transfection protocol has been developed that makes use of a synthetic cationic lipid, N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA). Small unilamellar liposomes containing DOTMA interact spontaneously with DNA to form lipid-DNA complexes with 100% entrapment of the DNA, DOTMA facilitates fusion of the complex with the plasma membrane of tissue culture cells, resulting in both uptake and expression of the DNA. The technique is simple, highly reproducible, and effective for both transient and stable expression of transfected DNA. Depending upon the cell line, lipofection is from 5- to greater than 100-fold more effective than either the calcium phosphate or the DEAE-dextran transfection technique.},

abstract={Advances in gene-based medicine since 1990s have ushered in new therapeutic strategy of gene therapy for inborn error genetic diseases and cancer. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma remain virtually untreatable and lethal. Currently available treatment for brain tumors including radical surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, have substantially improved the survival rate in patients suffering from these brain tumors; however, it remains incurable in large proportion of patients. Therefore, there is substantial need for effective, low-toxicity therapies for patients with malignant brain tumors, and gene therapy targeting brain tumors should fulfill this requirement. Gene therapy for brain tumors includes many therapeutic strategies and these strategies can be grouped in two major categories: molecular and immunologic. The widely used molecular gene therapy approach is suicide gene therapy based on the conversion of non-toxic prodrugs into active anticancer agents via introduction of enzymes and genetic immunotherapy involves the gene transfer of immune-stimulating cytokines including IL-4, IL-12 and TRAIL. For both molecular and immune gene therapy, neural stem cells (NSCs) can be used as delivery vehicle of therapeutic genes. NSCs possess an inherent tumor tropism that supports their use as a reliable delivery vehicle to target therapeutic gene products to primary brain tumors and metastatic cancers throughout the brain. Significance of the NSC-based gene therapy for brain tumor is that it is possible to exploit the tumor-tropic property of NSCs to mediate effective, tumor-selective therapy for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and outside, for which no tolerated curative treatments are currently available.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={In one study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture, people from North Dakota were interviewed to discover which moral principles they use in evaluating the morality of transgenic organisms and their introduction into markets. It was found that although the moral codes the human subjects employed were very similar, their views on transgenics were vastly different. In this paper, the codes that were used by the respondents are developed, compared to that of the academically composed Belmont Report, and then modified to create the more practical Common Moral Code. At the end, it is shown that the Common Moral Code has inherent inconsistency flaws that might be resolvable, but would require extensive work on the definition of terms and principles. However, the effort is worthwhile, especially if it results in a common moral code that all those involved in the debate are willing to use in negotiating a resolution to their differences.

abstract={Objective: This study aimed to explore some factors influencing perceptions of human gene therapy. Method: A small qualitative study using two semi-structured interviews per participant (n = 22). The groups comprised (1) people with cystic fibrosis and members of their family (n = 9), and (2) students from a science evening class as well as lay members of the public selected from the practice list of a local general practitioner (n = 13). Results: This pilot study demonstrates support for somatic gene therapy and ambivalence about germline gene therapy. A clear distinction is drawn between therapy and enhancement, with the majority opposing gene enhancement. Conclusions: Attitudes towards the acceptability of gene therapy are not necessarily determined by experience of, or exposure to, a genetic condition. More research is needed with the general public to determine what is perceived to be acceptable public policy in this field. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel},

abstract ={A scalable transfection procedure using polyethylenimine (PEI) is described for the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line grown in suspension. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were used as reporter genes to monitor transfection efficiency and productivity. Up to 75% of GFP-positive cells were obtained using linear or branched 25 kDa PEI. The 293 cell line and two genetic variants, either expressing the SV40 large T-antigen (293T) or the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 protein (293E), were tested for protein expression. The highest expression level was obtained with 293E cells using the EBV oriP-containing plasmid pCEP4. We designed the pTT vector, an oriP-based vector having an improved cytomegalovirus expression cassette. Using this vector, 10- and 3-fold increases in SEAP expression was obtained in 293E cells compared with pcDNA3.1 and pCEP4 vectors, respectively. The presence of serum had a positive effect on gene transfer and expression. Transfection of suspension-growing cells was more efficient with linear PEI and was not affected by the presence of medium conditioned for 24 h. Using the pTT vector, >20 mg/l of purified His-tagged SEAP was recovered from a 3.5 l bioreactor. Intracellular proteins were also produced at levels as high as 50 mg/l, representing up to 20% of total cell proteins.},

abstract ={Gap junction channels provide a pathway for exchange of ions and small molecules between coupled cells, and this exchange is believed to be critical for normal tissue growth and development. As a test for a role of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication in control of cell growth, we have compared growth rates of communication-deficient human tumor cells (SKHep1) with clones stably transfected with cDNA encoding the rat liver gap junction protein connexin 32. In culture, growth rates for parental and transfected clones were similar. However, when sizes of tumors were evaluated following injection of these clones into athymic nude mice, growth rates for two well-coupled clones were significantly lower than for communication-deficient or poorly coupled clones. This study demonstrates that growth rate of these tumor cells in situ is negatively correlated with strength of intercellular communication.},
