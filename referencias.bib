	Abstract = {Transfection is a powerful analytical tool enabling study of the function of genes and gene products in cells. The transfection methods are broadly classified into three groups; biological, chemical, and physical. These methods have advanced to make it possible to deliver nucleic acids to specific subcellular regions of cells by use of a precisely controlled laser-microscope system. The combination of point-directed transfection and mRNA transfection is a new way of studying the function of genes and gene products. However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages so the optimum method depends on experimental design and objective.},

@article{Fraley:1980aa,
	Abstract = {DNA, isolated from Simian virus 40 (SV40), has been encapsulated in large (0.4-micrometer diameter) unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The procedure used for liposome preparation encapsulated the SV40 DNA at high efficiency (30 to 50% entrapment) and did not alter the physical or biological properties of the DNA molecules. The biological activity of the liposome-entrapped viral DNA was determined by plaque assays on a permissive monkey cell line. The infectivity of liposome-entrapped SV40 DNA was enhanced at least 100-fold over that of free naked DNA. Importantly, the infectivity of vesicle-entrapped DNA was resistant to DNase digestion, dependent on the amount of DNA encapsulated per vesicle and on the vesicle lipid composition. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine were the most efficient for delivery of DNA to cells (1.8 x 10(3) plaque-forming units/micrograms of DNA). Following the incubation of DNA-containing liposomes with cells, their infectivity could be enhanced an additional 10- to 200-fold by exposing the cells to high concentrations of polyethylene glycol or glycerol. Under these conditions the infectivity of liposome-encapsulated SV40 DNA (3 x 10(5) plaque-forming units/microgram) was comparable with values reported using the calcium phosphate method. In addition to providing a sensitive assay for monitoring and optimizing the delivery of vesicle contents to cells, the liposome-mediated delivery of nucleic acids may have potential for increasing the efficiency of DNA delivery to cells and for extending the number of cell types which can be transformed or transfected.},

@article{Fraley:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Delivery of liposome-encapsulated simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA to African green monkey Related to been used as a probe to study liposome--cell interactions and to determine conditions which favor the intracellular delivery of liposome contents to cells. The efficiency of DNA delivery by various liposome preparations (monitored by infectivity assays) was found to be dependent both on the magnitude of vesicle binding to cells and on the resistance of liposomes to cell-induced leakage of contents. Acidic phospholipids were much more effective in both binding and delivery, and phosphatidylserine (PS) was the best in both aspects. The inclusion of 50 mol % cholesterol in liposomes reduces the cell-induced leakage of vesicle contents (2--5-fold) and substantially enhances the delivery of DNA to cells (2--10-fold). Following incubation of cells with negatively charged liposomes containing SV40 DNA, infectivity can be enhanced greatly by brief exposure of the cells to glycerol solutions. In contrast, only slight enhancement by glycerol was observed for SV40 DNA encapsulated in neutral or positively charged liposomes. The results of competition experiments between empty phosphatidylcholine liposomes and DNA-containing PS liposomes also suggest possible differences in the interaction of neutral and negatively charged liposome preparations with cells. Morphological studies indicate that the glycerol treatment stimulates membrane ruffling and vacuolization and suggest that the enhanced uptake of liposomes occurs by an endocytosis-like process. Results obtained with metabolic inhibitors are also consistent with the interpretation that the enhancement of liposome delivery in glycerol-treated cells occurs via an energy-dependent endocytotic pathway. Pretreatment of cells with chloroquine, a drug which alters lysosomal activity, further enhanced infectivity in glycerol-treated cells (4-fold). This observation suggests the involvement of a lysosomal processing step at some point in the expression of liposome-encapsulated DNA and, more importantly, illustrates the possibility of altering cellular mechanism to engineer more efficient delivery by liposomes. Under optimal conditions determined in this study, the efficiency of liposome-mediated SV40 DNA delivery was increased more than 1000-fold over that obtained by simply incubating cells with liposomes. It is also demonstrated that these conditions enhance delivery of other molecules, besides DNA, which are encapsulated in liposomes.},

@article{Straus:1980aa,
	Abstract = {Cell ghosts were formed by hypotonic haemolysis and subsequent isotonic re-sealing of human erythrocytes in the presence of adenovirus type 2 DNA. The ghosts entrapped virus DNA with an efficiency which depended on the salt concentration employed during haemolysis and on the concentration of the DNA itself. The entrapped DNA was largely protected from digestion by deoxyribonuclease I and could be recovered intact by phenol extraction. Erythrocyte ghosts containing 32P-adenovirus type 2 DNA were fused with KB cells during brief treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Following fusion, counts equivalent to an average of 25 molecules of labelled DNA were micro-injected and transported to each KB cell nucleus. Less than 1/4 as many DNA counts were recovered from nuclei when PEG treatment was omitted. A direct immunofluorescent assay demonstrated virus replication in some cells following their fusion with DNA-containing ghosts. The efficiency of transfection was considerably lower than that expected from the large number of successfully micro-injected DNA molecules. This suggests that most of the micro-injected DNA molecules were degraded before a successful infection could be completed.},

@article{Neumann:1982aa,
	Abstract = {Electric impulses (8 kV/cm, 5 microseconds) were found to increase greatly the uptake of DNA into cells. When linear or circular plasmid DNA containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene is added to a suspension of mouse L cells deficient in the TK gene and the cells are then exposed to electric fields, stable transformants are formed that survive in the HAT selection medium. At 20 degrees C after the application of three successive electric impulses followed by 10 min to allow DNA entry there result 95 (+/- 3) transformants per 10(6) cells and per 1.2 micrograms DNA. Compared with biochemical techniques, the electric field method of gene transfer is very simple, easily applicable, and very efficient. Because the mechanism of DNA transport through cell membranes is not known, a simple physical model for the enhanced DNA penetration into cells in high electric fields is proposed. According to this ' electroporation model' the interaction of the external electric field with the lipid dipoles of a pore configuration induces and stabilizes the permeation sites and thus enhances cross membrane transport.},

	Abstract = {The enhancement by diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) of the infectivity of poliovirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) for cell cultures was demonstrated by infective-center as well as by plaque assays, both in nonprimate (L) and primate cell systems (MK, HeLa, LLC-MK(2)). The sensitivity of plaque assays was greatly improved by using a tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-buffered synthetic medium (basal medium Eagle) and freshly confluent cell monolayers. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was directly dependent on the molecular weight of the DEAE-D. Two observations bearing on the action of DEAE-D appeared important: ribonuclease activity was reduced by DEAE-D, and cells pretreated with DEAE-D remained susceptible to infection with RNA in isotonic medium. Appreciable susceptibility of the treated cells persisted for at least 2 hr; the susceptible state could be reversed at will by an application of heparin. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was independent of an effect of DEAE-D on intact virus and agar inhibitors.},

@article{Vile,
	Abstract = {Gene therapy for the treatment of cancer was initiated with high levels of optimism and enthusiasm. Recently, this perception has had to be tempered by the realisation that efficiency and accuracy of gene delivery remain the most significant barriers to its success. So far, there has been a disappointing inability to reach target cells with sufficient efficacy to generate high enough levels of direct killing and this has necessitated the invocation of bystander effects in order for any potential strategy to be convincing. At least in the foreseeable future, clinical advance will come from co-operation with other more established disciplines - such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This is inevitable - and necessary - in order to prove that gene therapy can have efficacy as part of a combinatorial therapy, before hoping to move clinical mountains alone. In addition, there will have to be a thorough understanding of the clinical situations in which gene therapy will be used in order both to understand its own limitations, and to exploit its full potential. This will enable it to find the appropriate clinical niche in which its abilities will be optimally useful. Finally, anyone wishing to practise clinical cancer gene therapy will rapidly have to learn the ways of the free market and be able to juggle commercial necessities with ideological purity.

@article{Chen,
	Abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. They play a vital role in the initiation of immune response by presenting antigens to T cells and followed by induction of T-cell response. Reported research in animal studies indicated that vaccine immunity could be a promising alternative therapy for cancer patients. However, broad clinical utility has not been achieved yet, owing to the low transfection efficiency of DCs. Therefore, it is essential to improve the transfection efficiency of DC-based vaccination in immunotherapy. In several studies, DCs were genetically engineered by tumor-associated antigens or by immune molecules such as costimulatory molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Encouraging results have been achieved in cancer treatment using various animal models. This paper describes the recent progress in gene delivery systems including viral vectors and nonviral carriers for DC-based genetically engineered vaccines. The reverse and three-dimensional transfection systems developed in DCs are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Liposomes modified with TAT peptide (TATp-liposomes) showed fast and efficient translocation into the cell cytoplasm with subsequent migration into the perinuclear zone. TATp-liposomes containing a small quantity (≤10 mol %) of a cationic lipid formed firm noncovalent complexes with DNA. Here, we present results demonstrating both in vitro and in vivo transfection with TATp-liposome--DNA complexes. Mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were transfected with such complexes in vitro. The transfection with the TATp-liposome-associated pEGFP-N1 plasmid encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was high, whereas the cytotoxicity was lower than that of commonly used cationic lipid-based gene-delivery systems. Intratumoral injection of TATp-liposome--DNA complexes into the Lewis lung carcinoma tumor of mice also resulted in an expression of GFP in tumor cells. This transfection system should be useful for various protocols of cell treatment in vitro or ex vivo as well as for localized in vivo gene therapy.},

	Abstract = {Gene therapy involves the transfer and expression of a therapeutic gene into a target tissue, and essentially represents an intervention that alters the instruction set of a cell having a dominant effect on the cell phenotype. Gene therapy techniques may provide a realistic therapeutic option for CNS disorders that are difficult to treat with conventional drugs, such as for drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Preclinical studies using a selection of 'therapeutic'genes delivered into the rodent brain showed significant reduction of seizures and inhibition of epileptogenesis, thus establishing the proof-of-principle evidence of the potential applicability of this technology to human epilepsy. The promising potential of gene therapy for the treatment of CNS pathologies still requires further investigation to improve the efficacy and the safety of this approach using clinically relevant experimental models. The recent advances in refining gene therapy tools and in methods of gene delivery make this innovative approach a definite possibility for therapeutic intervention.},

	Abstract = {The eye has unique advantages as a target organ for gene therapy of both inherited and acquired ocular disorders and offers a valuable model system for gene therapy. The eye is readily accessible to phenotypic examination and investigation of therapeutic effects in vivo by fundus imaging and electrophysiological techniques. Considerable progress has been made in the development of gene replacement therapies for retinal degenerations resulting from gene defects in photoreceptor cells (rds, RPGRIP, RS-1) and in retinal pigment epithelial cells (MerTK, RPE65, OA1) using recombinant adeno-associated virus and lentivirus-based vectors. Gene therapy also offers a potentially powerful approach to the treatment of complex acquired disorders such as those involving angiogenesis, inflammation and degeneration, by the targeted sustained intraocular delivery of therapeutic proteins. Proposals for clinical trials of gene therapy for early-onset retinal degeneration owing to defects in the gene encoding the visual cycle protein RPE65 have recently received ethical approval.},

	Abstract = {Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function. It is hoped that forming tissue de novo will overcome many problems in plastic surgery associated with such areas as wound healing and the immunogenicity of transplanted tissue that lead to dysfunctional repair. Gene therapy is the science of the transfer of genetic material into individuals for therapeutic purposes by altering cellular function or structure at the molecular level. Recently, tissue engineering has been used in conjunction with gene therapy as a hybrid approach. This combination of stem-cell-based tissue engineering with gene therapy has the potential to provide regenerative tissue cells within an environment of optimal regulatory protein expression and would have many benefits in various areas such as the transplantation of skin, cartilage or bone. The aim of this review is to outline tissue engineering and possible applications of gene therapy in the field of biomedical engineering as well as basic principles of gene therapy, vectors and gene delivery.

	Abstract = {The concept and application of ethical principles in the context of medical research is changing rapidly. This is especially true for fast moving fields such as gene therapy, a relatively new but rapidly maturing field offering opportunities to influence health at a fundamental level, which may become a cornerstone of medicine. By 2004, over 700 gene therapy clinical protocols had been initiated worldwide, and two highly publicized gene therapy-related side effects have helped to shape recent ethical debate. These events have influenced not only clinical trial design but also public opinion and systems of independent oversight. Both the science of gene therapy and the regulatory environment are continually evolving. How well the field is able to respond to these challenges will determine the extent to which gene therapy will ultimately be integrated into medical practice.},

TGF-beta and PDGF are known to play a critical role in the regulation of ECM metabolism and mesenchymal cell proliferation, respectively. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the direct role of each of these growth factors in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. Using an in vivo transfection technique, we could realize the selective overexpression of single growth factor in the kidney. The introduction of either TGF-beta or PDGF-B gene alone into the kidney induced glomerulosclerosis, although the patterns of action of these growth factors were different; TGF-beta affected ECM accumulation rather than cell proliferation and PDGF affected the latter rather than the former.},

@article{Seung,
	Abstract = {Advances in gene-based medicine since 1990s have ushered in new therapeutic strategy of gene therapy for inborn error genetic diseases and cancer. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma remain virtually untreatable and lethal. Currently available treatment for brain tumors including radical surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, have substantially improved the survival rate in patients suffering from these brain tumors; however, it remains incurable in large proportion of patients. Therefore, there is substantial need for effective, low-toxicity therapies for patients with malignant brain tumors, and gene therapy targeting brain tumors should fulfill this requirement. Gene therapy for brain tumors includes many therapeutic strategies and these strategies can be grouped in two major categories: molecular and immunologic. The widely used molecular gene therapy approach is suicide gene therapy based on the conversion of non-toxic prodrugs into active anticancer agents via introduction of enzymes and genetic immunotherapy involves the gene transfer of immune-stimulating cytokines including IL-4, IL-12 and TRAIL. For both molecular and immune gene therapy, neural stem cells (NSCs) can be used as delivery vehicle of therapeutic genes. NSCs possess an inherent tumor tropism that supports their use as a reliable delivery vehicle to target therapeutic gene products to primary brain tumors and metastatic cancers throughout the brain. Significance of the NSC-based gene therapy for brain tumor is that it is possible to exploit the tumor-tropic property of NSCs to mediate effective, tumor-selective therapy for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and outside, for which no tolerated curative treatments are currently available.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {In one study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture, people from North Dakota were interviewed to discover which moral principles they use in evaluating the morality of transgenic organisms and their introduction into markets. It was found that although the moral codes the human subjects employed were very similar, their views on transgenics were vastly different. In this paper, the codes that were used by the respondents are developed, compared to that of the academically composed Belmont Report, and then modified to create the more practical Common Moral Code. At the end, it is shown that the Common Moral Code has inherent inconsistency flaws that might be resolvable, but would require extensive work on the definition of terms and principles. However, the effort is worthwhile, especially if it results in a common moral code that all those involved in the debate are willing to use in negotiating a resolution to their differences.

	Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to explore some factors influencing perceptions of human gene therapy. Method: A small qualitative study using two semi-structured interviews per participant (n = 22). The groups comprised (1) people with cystic fibrosis and members of their family (n = 9), and (2) students from a science evening class as well as lay members of the public selected from the practice list of a local general practitioner (n = 13). Results: This pilot study demonstrates support for somatic gene therapy and ambivalence about germline gene therapy. A clear distinction is drawn between therapy and enhancement, with the majority opposing gene enhancement. Conclusions: Attitudes towards the acceptability of gene therapy are not necessarily determined by experience of, or exposure to, a genetic condition. More research is needed with the general public to determine what is perceived to be acceptable public policy in this field. Copyright {\copyright} 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel},

	Abstract = {A scalable transfection procedure using polyethylenimine (PEI) is described for the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line grown in suspension. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were used as reporter genes to monitor transfection efficiency and productivity. Up to 75% of GFP-positive cells were obtained using linear or branched 25 kDa PEI. The 293 cell line and two genetic variants, either expressing the SV40 large T-antigen (293T) or the Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 protein (293E), were tested for protein expression. The highest expression level was obtained with 293E cells using the EBV oriP-containing plasmid pCEP4. We designed the pTT vector, an oriP-based vector having an improved cytomegalovirus expression cassette. Using this vector, 10- and 3-fold increases in SEAP expression was obtained in 293E cells compared with pcDNA3.1 and pCEP4 vectors, respectively. The presence of serum had a positive effect on gene transfer and expression. Transfection of suspension-growing cells was more efficient with linear PEI and was not affected by the presence of medium conditioned for 24 h. Using the pTT vector, >20 mg/l of purified His-tagged SEAP was recovered from a 3.5 l bioreactor. Intracellular proteins were also produced at levels as high as 50 mg/l, representing up to 20% of total cell proteins.},

	Abstract = {Gap junction channels provide a pathway for exchange of ions and small molecules between coupled cells, and this exchange is believed to be critical for normal tissue growth and development. As a test for a role of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication in control of cell growth, we have compared growth rates of communication-deficient human tumor cells (SKHep1) with clones stably transfected with cDNA encoding the rat liver gap junction protein connexin 32. In culture, growth rates for parental and transfected clones were similar. However, when sizes of tumors were evaluated following injection of these clones into athymic nude mice, growth rates for two well-coupled clones were significantly lower than for communication-deficient or poorly coupled clones. This study demonstrates that growth rate of these tumor cells in situ is negatively correlated with strength of intercellular communication.},

abstract ={Environmental risk assessment of genetically modified organisms requires determination of their fitness and invasiveness relative to conspecifics and other ecosystem members. Cultured growth hormone transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in large enhancements in body size (>7-fold) relative to nontransgenic salmon, but in nature, the ability to compete for available food is a key factor determining survival fitness and invasiveness of a genotype. When transgenic and nontransgenic salmon were cohabitated and competed for different levels of food, transgenic salmon consistently outgrew nontransgenic fish and could affect the growth of nontransgenic cohorts except when food availability was high. When food abundance was low, dominant individuals emerged, invariably transgenic, that directed strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominated the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability was low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experienced population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only nontransgenic salmon had good (72.0 ± 4.3% SE) survival, and their population biomass continued to increase. Thus, effects of growth hormone transgenic salmon on experimental populations were primarily mediated by an interaction between food availability and population structure. These data, while indicative of forces which may act on natural populations, also underscore the importance of genotype by environment interactions in influencing risk assessment data for genetically modified organisms and suggest that, for species such as salmon which are derived from large complex ecosystems, considerable caution is warranted in applying data from individual studies.},

abstract ={Production of transgenic animals has raised concern regarding their potential ecological impact should they escape or be released to the natural environment. This concern has arisen mainly from research on laboratory-reared animals and theoretical modeling exercises. In this study, we used biocontained naturalized stream environments and conventional hatchery environments to show that differences in phenotype between transgenic and wild genotypes depend on rearing conditions and, critically, that such genotype-by-environment interactions may influence subsequent ecological effects in nature. Genetically wild and growth hormone transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were reared from the fry stage under either standard hatchery conditions or under naturalized stream conditions. When reared under standard hatchery conditions, the transgenic fish grew almost three times longer than wild conspecifics and had (under simulated natural conditions) stronger predation effects on prey than wild genotypes (even after compensation for size differences). In contrast, when fish were reared under naturalized stream conditions, transgenic fish were only 20% longer than the wild fish, and the magnitude of difference in relative predation effects was much reduced. These data show that genotype-by-environment interactions can influence the relative phenotype of transgenic and wild-type organisms and that extrapolations of ecological consequences from phenotypes developed in the unnatural laboratory environment may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of ecological risk. Thus, for transgenic organisms that may not be released to nature, the establishment of a range of highly naturalized environments will be critical for acquiring reliable experimental data to be used in risk assessments.},
